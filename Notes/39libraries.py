'''
The Pandas library in Python is a powerful, open-source tool used for data manipulation and analysis. It is built on top of NumPy and provides high-level, easy-to-use data structures:
	1.	Key Data Structures:
	•	Series: A one-dimensional array-like object, similar to a list or array, with labeled indices.
	•	DataFrame: A two-dimensional tabular data structure, similar to an Excel spreadsheet or SQL table, with rows and columns.
	2.	Core Features:
	•	Reading/writing data from various file formats (CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, etc.).
	•	Handling missing data efficiently.
	•	Filtering, slicing, and subsetting data.
	•	Aggregating and grouping data for statistical analysis.
	•	Merging, joining, and concatenating datasets.
	•	Data visualization capabilities when integrated with libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
	3.	Common Use Cases:
	•	Cleaning and preprocessing data for machine learning.
	•	Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
	•	Time-series analysis and financial modeling.

Pandas is widely used in data science and analytics due to its simplicity and performance.
