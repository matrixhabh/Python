# mainly there are two approaches that are used to write program or code.

# 1). Procedural Programming
# 2). Object-Oriented Programming

'''
One of the key features of OOP in Python is encapsulation, 
which means that the internal state of an object is hidden and can only be accessed 
or modified through the object's methods. This helps to protect the object's data 
and prevent it from being modified in unexpected ways.

Another key feature of OOP in Python is inheritance, 
which allows new classes to be created that inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. 
This allows for code reuse and makes it easy to create new classes 
that have similar functionality to existing classes.

##
# Simple Procedural Programming-

def hello():
    print("Hello")

hello()

##
# Object-Oriented Programming-

# Basically helps in real world situations mostly

sales1 = 6000
profit1 = 2000
ad1 = 1000
# rajeev.sales

sales2 = 6000
profit2 = 2000
ad2 = 1000 
# vikrant.sales

sales3 = 6000
profit3 = 2000
ad3 = 1000

harry --> harry ki info wala form --> Object [entity]
tom --> tom ki info wala form --> Object [entity]
shubham -- shubham ki info wala form --> Object [entity]
# shubham.changeName("Shubhi")

Polymorphism is also supported in Python, which means that objects of 
different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class. 
This allows for greater flexibility in code and makes it easier to write code that can work 
with multiple types of objects.

# In summary, OOP in Python allows developers to model real-world concepts 
# and entities using classes and objects, encapsulate data, reuse code through inheritance, 
# and write more flexible code through polymorphism.
