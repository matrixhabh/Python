# Is it useful?
# Yes, it is useful when you want to run a script from another script.

# This idiom is useful because it allows you to reuse code from a script 
# by importing it as a module into another script, without running the code in the original script. 
# For example, consider the following script:

def main():
    print("Running script directly")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# If you run this script directly, it will output "Running script directly". 
# However, if you import it as a module into another script and call the main function from the imported module, 
# it will not output anything:

import script

script.main()  # Output: "Running script directly"

# This can be useful if you have code that you want to reuse in multiple scripts, 
# but you only want it to run when the script is run directly and not when it's imported as a module.

# NECESSARY?

# It's important to note that the if __name__ == "__main__" idiom is not required to run a Python script.

''' You can still run a script without it by simply calling the functions 
 or running the code you want to execute directly. '''

# However, the if __name__ == "__main__" idiom can be a useful tool for organizing 
# and separating code that should be run directly from code that should be imported and used as a module.
